<b> Classifying The Economist Articles</b> <br >
As an avid reader of The Economist, I have always wondered if it was possible to distinguish the authors of the anonymously written articles solely based on their texts. Although the articles have no byline, each section of The Economist has an accompanying blog and these blog post do include the author's initials. I trained a multinomial Naives Bayes classifier on the texts of the blog posts to predict the author's initials. I then proceeded to use this model to predict the authors in the accompanying section of The Economist based on their texts.
